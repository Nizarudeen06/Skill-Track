"""No-show job: marks slot bookings MISSED and records a score=0 attempt.

Rule used: consistent with the existing scoring architecture — a no-show is
treated as a failed attempt with score 0 (counts toward max_attempts, triggers
removal if it was the last allowed attempt). No point deduction is applied
because the existing system only awards points, never deducts them.

Idempotent: each booking is processed at most once (status transitions to
'missed' atomically; the attempt is only recorded if no attempt already exists
after the slot start time for that student+level).
